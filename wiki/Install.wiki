= Installing OpenCVDotNet =

If all you want is to play around with the binary version of OpenCVDotNet (write some OpenCV apps from C#), follow these steps:

 # Download and install [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22870&package_id=16937 OpenCV]. Make sure to install OpenCV to {{{C:\Program Files\OpenCV}}}, or otherwise OpenCVDotNet DLLs will not be able to find it.

 # Download and install [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualcsharp/download/ Visual C# Express]

 # Download & install the latest version of [http://code.google.com/p/opencvdotnet/downloads/list OpenCVDotNet].

After installation, binaries and source code will be installed to {{{C:\Program Files\OpenCVDotNet}}}. In the Start Menu, you can open "OpenCVDotNet Examples", which will open up Visual C# Express with the examples solution.

Press CTRL+F5 to build and run the examples program.
